We need to use Lease Templates for our main lease but need to use PDF Form Templates for our addenda, which are on standard forms. My question is how will this flow work in practice when setting up a new tenant. ( 5m 25s ) John T: Hi Incline, I see. When going through the move in flow you will have the three options: Generate Lease with Lease Templates Generate Lease with PDF Form Templates -Upload Fully Executed Lease Once they have been moved in and have signed one or the other you can click 'Send lease or addenda' to send another after. ( 9m 5s ) Incline: Is there no way to send the addenda until after they've signed the lease? Legally, the addenda are all part of the lease, so we legally have to send them together. I'm afraid if we can't work this, we will have to use the Upload Fully Executed Lease option, which doesn't streamline anything we're already doing. ( 13m 44s ) John T: I see, One moment (: ( 16m 33s ) John T: So in the move in flow, when you select your lease, you are also able to select the addenda you would like to add as well. They will both be within the same lease that will be generated and sent to tenant for signing ( 19m 5s ) Incline: I think that's only addenda you set up along with a lease template. Here is the situation... there are addenda that must be done in the Real Estate Board's PDF Form. We can't just type the info in to create a new addenda in appfolio ( 19m 48s ) Incline: In other words, we have to use a mixture of PDF forms and the lease template. ( 22m 3s ) John T: I see, yeah I do not believe AppFolio currently supports sending a mixture of both at the moment, it would have to be one or the other during the move in process. I can certainly present this idea to our product team, but please feel free to submit this idea to our Product Suggestion Board. If you click the ""Make a Suggestion"" link from the 'Help & Training' tab at the top right in your database. It seems as of right now the best thing to do is have these printed and wet signed since AppFolio is unable to electronically send both at once for signatures. Unless you send one, get it fully signed, then send the other."

The pros of using the PDF is you don't have to type in all the words again. If you want to create a lease from scratch then you have to type in all the info that you need for the tenant to read.

Enter a question to start a conversation with a Live Support Agent. ( 1m 36s ) Mike: does the system auto renew for a tenant who is staying after a lease expires? what do we have to do on our end if anything? ( 3m 15s ) Nicholas V: Hi Mike! A tenant will remain as an active tenant even if their lease expiration date passes. Typically, you would want to generate a new lease with updated dates for these tenants. ( 7m 57s ) Mike: our tenants typically are month to month after the expiration unless they indicate to us they are leaving. ( 9m 6s ) Nicholas V: You can also generate month-to-month leases as well for them. That way those lease dates get updated. ( 11m 14s ) Mike: how do we update lease dates? ( 13m 41s ) Mike: I am not sure we are doing it correctly and need to be sure ( 15m 49s ) Nicholas V: If you generate a new lease for the tenants to sign electronically the system will update those lease dates for you on their tenant page. If you manually print out a month-to-month lease for them to sign physically then you can navigate to their tenant page and scroll down to the lease information section. From there you can click on the edit button and update the lease dates manually. ( 18m 16s ) Mike: example: if a lease expires 5/31/22 and the tenant is staying, what date is used if the lease goes to a month to month basis? ( 20m 21s ) Nicholas V: If there lease expires on 5/31/2022 and they are moving to a month to month lease then in that Lease Information section you checkmark the Month to Month box and they would have a start date of 6/1/2022. You can then also designate the date it was renewed. ( 23m 51s ) Mike: our staff was editing the lease end date on the tenant screen to 5/31/2023. do they check the month to month box and enter an end date? ( 26m 39s ) Nicholas V: When you checkmark the Month to Month box you aren't given an option to enter an end date. You would only have the ability to enter in a Start date and a Renewed on date. For example you would have start date of 6/1/2022 and then they could leave the renewed on date blank until the following month comes along. Where they can enter that it renewed on 7/1/2022 and so forth. ( 28m 58s ) Mike: can you see my data if I give you a tenant? ( 30m 17s ) Nicholas V: Yes, I can view your database. ( 31m 59s ) Mike: paulette jones ( 32m 8s ) Mike: expired 4/30/22 ( 33m 51s ) Nicholas V: I have the tenant pulled up. What is your end goal for this specific tenant? They are currently on a month to month lease correct? ( 36m 4s ) Mike: thank you. this tenant is staying and is now month to month until she gives notice. we updated the monthly rent. ( 37m 37s ) Nicholas V: You can update her lease information section to have month to month set to yes that way you can group the tenants that are on a month to month when running leasing reports. You can then designate the start date of that month to month lease. ( 40m 58s ) Mike: ok so to be sure, our staff need to be doing this for all tenants as their leases come up for renewal every month? ( 42m 28s ) Nicholas V: Right, you would want to update the renewed on date for each month that it gets renewed. ( 45m 10s ) Mike: thank you. I am sure you can understand my concern with this.

Therefore, if you wish to chnage anything on this document, you will need to resend a new lease with the edited information. Once signed and fully executed, it will overwrite the original lease already on the tenant's page ( 17m 27s ) Amberley P: Are you still there?

Let me look into this for you, one moment please :) ( 2m 31s ) Ryan: yea no rush ( 2m 54s ) Ryan: i feel like i had some automatically posted a few weeks ago, then i updated all properties and now none of them automatically post. ( 4m 34s ) Madeline P: It looks like what you have described is already the existing functionality of the Renewal Fee! Regarding Renewal Fees, it looks like ""The bill is automatically posted once the renewal is countersigned or printed and marked as fully executed."" See the following for more info: Are you seeing that the system is not posting the bill as expected? ( 4m 59s ) Madeline P: If you have an example property I can take a closer look! ( 8m 23s ) Ryan: that is correct ( 8m 41s ) Ryan: system is not posting when fully executed or countersigned ( 9m 24s ) Madeline P: Do you have an example or two of properties that didn't have bills post as expected? I can take a closer look! ( 12m 7s ) Ryan: sure 6305 ravena unit 3 ( 12m 35s ) Ryan: 1208 fall meadow ( 12m 41s ) Ryan: i entered all of those manually ( 12m 57s ) Madeline P: Thanks!

( 17m 10s ) Madeline P: Just looked into your first example. Looks like this was the one you created: And this was the one automatically created, it appears: ( 17m 43s ) Ryan: so maybe the best play is to change those date and pay them as of today ( 17m 51s ) Ryan: because i dont want to wait for those to hit ( 18m 15s ) Madeline P: Yeah you can go into your Payables, located the bill that was automatically created, and edit the date on it if needed! :) ( 18m 24s ) Ryan: oh boy i have alot lol ( 18m 29s ) Ryan: ok, thank you for the help! ( 18m 45s ) Madeline P: Sure thing! I hope you have a great day Ryan! Reach out if we can further assist :) ( 19m 43s ) Ryan: thank you !@ ( 20m 35s ) Madeline P: Of course! :)"

( 2m 26s ) John T: Hi Mindy! I see, is there any error message this applicant is receiving? ( 3m 35s ) Mindy: Sorry it is the screening that will not run on him. It says he does not have a US address. Does the screeners not do anything foreign? ( 4m 54s ) Mindy: I assumed that since Puerto Ricp is a US Territory it would be fine. ( 5m 33s ) John T: If he has a social security # then it should be fine ( 5m 46s ) John T: The Credit Bureau databases only contain social security numbers, so those are the only data fields we are able to match on. If the applicant has an ITIN available you can enter that but it will not be used to match the applicant. Because the databases don’t contain ITIN, passport, or green card numbers, that data isn’t something that will be matched through AppFolio’s screening process. ( 5m 54s ) John T: You can place 999-99-9999 in the SSN field in order to process the application, however, attempting to screen an applicant without a valid SSN or with any other incorrect information will not yield reliable results. To retrieve accurate credit data on a screening report, you need to enter a valid SSN. Eviction and criminal data do not rely as heavily on an SSN, so the consumer records are more likely to match from those databases."

( 34m 14s ) Leah: Actually, we think we enabled all of the accounts we want to use right now. However, I always see expenses going out in the yellow ""warning"" or ""transaction error"" boxes instead of being listed properly. Is this because we didn't link the accounts correctly? Or is it just an extra step to verify our expenses? ( 36m 6s ) Liz C: Interesting, if I may ask, do you see this on a specific bank page?

The banner will indicate that some transactions are missing, you can generally enter the corresponding transactions in Appfolio to reflect what is recorded on the bank. ( 45m 4s ) Leah: Ok, so Appfolio is seeing transactions in the bank that Appfolio basically doesn't know about? And that's why it's popping up like that? ( 45m 20s ) Leah: That's something I fix when I reconcile with the bank statements then later right? ( 45m 52s ) Leah: That makes more sense. ( 46m 56s ) Liz C: Correct, this is something that can be fixed at the time of reconciliation or earlier, depending on your preference :) ( 47m 43s ) Leah: Ok cool that clears that up. And that's not something that we did wrong when sycing, you think? It;s just how it is going to work? ( 48m 40s ) Liz C: Correct, this does not mean the sync had not been successful, rather, is just highlighting some transaction that were not located within Appfolio ( 49m 26s ) Leah: Ok cool cool thank you very much ( 50m 13s ) Leah: That was all the questions I had.

I recommend canceling the move-in for one of them, then add them as an additional tenant in the other and select unit 109. ( 6m 56s ) Dawn: Was that something they needed to do on application or was it something I did wrong to avoid in the future? ( 8m 23s ) Jevon G: You can always manually group their applications together. Alternatively, when applying they are asked if they are applying with another person. This will also group the application together. ( 9m 32s ) Dawn: But, Ethan did state he was applying with Mizraim on his application ( 10m 58s ) Dawn: & in reviewing Mizraim's app, he also stated that he was applying with Ethan.

( 17m 48s ) Jevon G: All that I'm able to see is that the applications are not grouped together. If you would like to do so, you can cancel both move-ins and then group them together then restart the move-in. It doesn't look like these applications were ever grouped. ( 18m 47s ) Dawn: I'm sorry. I still don't understand what you are saying. I'm not the one responsible for grouping them, am I? ( 19m 16s ) Dawn: Can you correct on your end so I don't need to delete anything?

( 10m 50s ) Megan S: I would suggest (this is how we did it in my previous role) Manually adding or importing in the application first and then converting the applicant to a tenant.

( 15s ) Morgan J: Good Morning Parker ( 22s ) Parker: good morning Morgan ( 22s ) Morgan J: Happy Tuesday ( 40s ) Parker: We have an applicant that needs to add a co-signer to their application ( 51s ) Parker: Where do they/we find the link to provide the other applicants? ( 1m 3s ) Morgan J: What is the name of the applicant? ( 1m 20s ) Parker: Morgan Oliver ( 2m 0s ) Morgan J: Did they fill out the application? ( 2m 48s ) Parker: I'm sorry, it's Megan Oliver ( 4m 22s ) Morgan J: ok, one moment please ( 4m 34s ) Parker: thank you ( 7m 23s ) Morgan J: The co-signer will need to fill out the application separately, so you can email them their own rental application and then you can group them together once the co-signers application comes in ( 7m 46s ) Parker: But won't that make the co-signer have to pay an extra Admin fee? ( 8m 23s ) Parker: I've seen additional applicants get added after the application was submitted, how was that done? ( 9m 2s ) Morgan J: You can manually add the rental application so then they do not have to pay a fee and group the co-signer with Megan, but you will need their information still to fill it out ( 10m 9s ) Parker: On the help article ""Group Rental Applications"" it states that there should be a shareable link to provide people. ( 11m 35s ) Morgan J: Yes, there is, but did the tenant follow the instructions in the help article before submitting the rental application? If so, then the co-signer should have received the link ( 15m 6s ) Parker: The potential tenant/applicant did not know what instructions to follow. They are trying to add the co-signer after the application was submitted. ( 15m 28s ) Parker: I'm not going to lie, that is not a helpful comment, Morgan. ( 19m 7s ) Parker: Like, how would they have access to the help articles that I'm looking at now? ( 19m 49s ) Parker: Please don't answer that. If there is absolutely no way for her to add a co-signer to the application, then I will just have to get a paper application from them. ( 19m 58s ) Morgan J: I apologize, I am just trying to get all the information. Even if the applicant had selected the co-signer and sent the email, the co-signer would still have had to pay an application fee, as each submitted application is required to pay the fee. The way to avoid paying the application fee is to manually add the co-signer by doing a manually entered application and then grouping the co-signer with Megan. Our engineering team added the manual application feature so we have a way to group the applicants after the applications are submitted ( 23m 1s ) Parker: We had an future tenant submit an application two weeks ago, we let them know that they did not meet income requirements, so they added an additional applicant who filled out all of the information online, paid just the application fee, and we saw it come through on AppFolio. ( 23m 51s ) Parker: I know that everyone must pay application fees, but we have an Administrative fee that is a one-time charge per apartment, not per applicant. ( 26m 58s ) Morgan J: I am not sure how the additional application got the link, but there is a feature you can enable that will send the applicant an email with the shareable link once the application was submitted ( 27m 3s ) Morgan J: here is the help article ( 28m 26s ) Parker: I did see this while looking for a solution, thank you. This will definitely help with any applicant in the future that has the same issue. ( 29m 5s ) Morgan J: You are very welcome ( 29m 50s ) Parker: I will activate this and see if there is a way to retroactively send the email out to Megan, otherwise I'll have to get a paper application. ( 31m 4s ) Morgan J: Great! You can always do the paper application and then enter the co-signer manually to add her to Megan's application. But once the feature is enabled, this will prevent any other issues like this in the future :) ( 31m 52s ) Parker: thanks"

( 7m 18s ) Madeline P: It seems that perhaps making sure the Prorate Charges box is unchecked will work, but I'm not 100% certain. Are you in the middle of the renewal flow for the tenant in question? Feel free to provide me with their name and I can take a look! ( 8m 32s ) Jessica: Yes, Stanislaw Byczkowski ( 8m 59s ) Jessica: I have not yet generarte his offer but wanted to do so with a $100 rent charge ( 10m 42s ) Madeline P: I'm not seeing any existing recurring charges for him has his rent been charged manually up until now? ( 11m 7s ) Jessica: we use this unit to practice so there is no rent charge right now ( 15m 43s ) Madeline P: Hmmm, I see. This tenant's situation is more simplified so I'm not sure we can generalize this process for all tenants who already have existing charges. (Just fyi!) It looks like if you add the new monthly charge in the renewal flow, that it will default to have a start date of the first day of the lease. If you have insert fields on your lease it may be simpler to go ahead and proceed to add the charge in the renewal flow, and then we can verify that everything looks good on the tenant page after the fact. Generally speaking, the renewal flow can get a little tricky with mid month renewals and recurring charges. :) If you'd like I can create a case so we can look into this a bit more for you before you make any changes! ( 19m 51s ) Madeline P: Are you still with me Jessica? :) ( 20m 43s ) Jessica: sorry! ( 21m 18s ) Jessica: that would be great! ( 21m 28s ) Jessica: would me providing another resident help?

( 5m 55s ) Hanah B: Yeah it's usually a browser issue that can be resolved with switching/confirming google chrome is being used and that the browser cache is cleared.

( 6m 7s ) Jennifer: ( 6m 9s ) Jennifer: that? ( 6m 25s ) Jennifer: It auto populated as a bill to the owner once the tenants lease renewed ( 13m 39s ) Ryan P: Interesting I am still looking. ( 13m 51s ) Jennifer: ok thank you ( 22m 27s ) Ryan P: The issue is because the tenant's do not have a lease renewal charge on their tenants ledger. ( 22m 56s ) Jennifer: the tenants are not paying that fee the owner pays it so therefore it wouldnt show up on the tenant page correct? ( 23m 24s ) Ryan P: That report you sent me is only looking at charges that the tenant paid for these GL accounts. ( 23m 46s ) Jennifer: im sorry what about this ( 23m 47s ) Jennifer: ( 24m 18s ) Ryan P: That is not a custom report and I do not see any info can you please try clicking actions save layout check the box that says lock in dates save then copy and paste it?

( 28m 0s ) Ryan P: There is still not charge for a lease fee on the tenant's side. ( 28m 41s ) Jennifer: its the $150 on there referrence 8011 ( 29m 7s ) Ryan P: That does not make it appear though on the tenant's side and therefore will not show up on your report. ( 29m 32s ) Jennifer: How do we have it show on the tenant side withouth the tenant paying that fee? ( 29m 51s ) Ryan P: I would look at other propertys where the lease renewal fee appears ( 30m 47s ) Jennifer: the problem is we were charging the tenant $50 for renewals and we recently changed so all of our new contract are a charge to the owner not the tenant. this is the first one we have done ( 33m 54s ) Jennifer: Is there any report that i can run that will show me this owner expense? I just figured since it was coded to the same GL account it would show up no matter if the tenant paid it or the owner paid it. The management fees and tenant placement fees show up on the report so not sure why this one isnt. ( 34m 39s ) Jennifer: ( 38m 19s ) Ryan P: So then if you did indeed change that there is no way for lease renewal fees to show up on the report. ( 38m 23s ) Ryan P: And that is why it is not appearing. ( 38m 56s ) Jennifer: how come the management fees will show up on this report but they aren't charged to the tenant? ( 39m 17s ) Ryan P: Because management fees are billed to you and not tenants. ( 39m 53s ) Jennifer: So the lease renewal fee on the property page is meant to be charged to the tenant? ( 40m 16s ) Ryan P: That is up to you, if you need that amount to show up on reports then yes it should be. ( 41m 20s ) Jennifer: so sounds like nothing we can do ( 42m 11s ) Jennifer: thank you for trying ( 43m 43s ) Ryan P: Of course! ( 43m 47s ) Ryan P: Thanks for chatting in."

AppFolio already disqualified him because the applicant only submitted one paystub for 1 job. ( 4m 9s ) Bebe: the applicant STILL needs to upload the paystub for his 2nd job and he will quialify ( 4m 19s ) Rachel B: Hi Bebe, are you able to receive the pay stubs from this applicant via email and edit the application manually to be in a different status and re-screened? ( 5m 25s ) Bebe: I don't know how to edit the application manually ( 5m 59s ) Bebe: I can ask the applicant to send me the paystubs by email ( 6m 9s ) Rachel B: Otherwise, you can manually enter in a new application for them since they have already paid the application fee, with the additional pay stubs and all info from the original application. Here is a help article on this: ( 6m 34s ) Rachel B: You can edit an application using this article, please take a look and let me know if you have questions!: ( 7m 24s ) Bebe: ok I'll read the information.

( 11m 32s ) Bebe: I need to say that one of the applicants assisted a second applicant to fill out her application and the lady she was assisting (her mother) didn't have an email address ( 13m 35s ) Bebe: so, the daughter included HER OWN email address as her mother's email address. Now there are 2 applications (mother's and daughter's) with the same email address. The Security Deposit has been paid. Everything has been done BUT the mother hasn't been able to sign the lease ( 14m 0s ) Bebe: How can we change the email for the mother's application ( 15m 30s ) Rachel B: Are you converting the applicants and they are in the move in flow already, or are they still applicants? If they are still applicants, you can use the helpa article I sent above to edit her application to update the mother's app with a new email address. It can be any email address she or her daughter has access to, but it cannot be the same as anyone else in the group. If they are being converted to tenants already, you can change the email address on the mother's tenant page. ( 17m 25s ) Bebe: They are in the move in flow already, except the ""mother"" hasn't received an email/link to sign the lease because her daughter used her own email address (same email address for two applications) and the mom hasn't received a lease to siggn ( 17m 33s ) Bebe: *sign ( 23m 14s ) Rachel B: I see. Please navigate to the mother's tenant page by searching her name in the searchbar, and then edit her info to give her a new email address, and in the online portal status section click to send activation so she can activate her portal to sign the lease. ( 24m 21s ) Bebe: ok, I'll try it in a couple of minutes. I hope I can do it correctly ( 27m 4s ) Rachel B: Of course, and you can send me the mother's name and I can link you to it as well. Once you convert to tenant and start the move in flow their tenant page is created so you can then edit everything, including their email address, on their tenant page.

I am trying to do a transfer on a tenant and put them in another unit, when i pull up the lease it has another tenants name on it and i am not sure why. I am trying to transfer Carl Spikes out of 13E and into 13A ( 1m 39s ) Kayla M: Got it! And are you currently also trying to send a lease to Carl? Whose name is showing up on the lease as well? ( 3m 54s ) Kayla M: Which lease template are you using? That could be the issue? ( 5m 49s ) Kayla M: This lease template has tenants' names listed on it instead of using Insert Fields: This is the one titled ""Lashoin Magnolia"" If you're using that lease, that's why the extra names are showing. ( 6m 46s ) Stephanie: WE always use lashoin Magnolia, my old assistant made this lease. SO i shouldn't use that one? ( 7m 6s ) Stephanie: and I am printing his lease out, hes an older gentleman so he doesn't do email ( 7m 20s ) Stephanie: i was preparing his lease when i saw the extra names ( 8m 32s ) Kayla M: You can, I would just edit it and remove Reggie White and Christian Jones names and add the ""Tenants (Financially Responsible)"" Insert Field instead. :) ( 9m 26s ) Stephanie: ok, how do I edit the lease? ( 10m 27s ) Kayla M: Go to this page and click on the section with the names: You can delete the names and click the Insert Field box to choose ""Tenants (Financially Responsible)"" to go there instead. ( 13m 37s ) Stephanie: ok I did that, so now as I am preparing the lease, it will automatically insert his name? ( 14m 24s ) Kayla M: Yes ma'am! Though I am not seeing that this change was made.

I just went and found that section of the template. Their names will need to be deleted there too. The same Insert Field can be added in its place: ( 27m 17s ) Stephanie: ok i did that but somehow i added a section so when i go to save it says error. If i delete section will it delete the whole 1.3 partioes to the lease or just that empty block?> ( 28m 58s ) Kayla M: Exit out of it real quick... let me see if I can edit it for you! ( 29m 42s ) Stephanie: ok thank you ( 31m 6s ) Kayla M: It should be ok now! Though should the address always be ""Address/Apt.No. A8 2133-2121 Vandivere Rd Augusta, GA 30904"" Or should that change depending on the tenant? ( 33m 19s ) Stephanie: it should change depending on the unit we put them in. Mr spikes will go in 2133 Vandivere Rd apt 13E aUGUSTA gA 30904 ( 35m 41s ) Kayla M: Ok! I would recommend adding an Insert Field in place of where the address appears on the lease as well. I'm going to send you an email with all of this information so you can revise as you see fit! Unfortunately I'm at the end of my chat shift. Is sslater@fouroakspm.com still the best email for you? ( 38m 2s ) Stephanie: YES THANK YOU ( 38m 38s ) Kayla M: Of course!

( 18m 44s ) Spencer S: Thank you I am going to create a case for you to investigate further. What is the best email and phone number to follow up with you? ( 19m 14s ) Marcy: Sure thing! 312-624-9766 and marcy@teamhideout.com ( 20m 47s ) Spencer S: Actually it looks like the main troubleshooting step is to cancel the lease, edit the pdf form to remove that field, then re-add the field again and resend the lease ( 20m 55s ) Spencer S: I can send you an email to follow up with me if that does not work though ( 22m 23s ) Marcy: OK. I'll try it. Maybe I'll just remove the required option all together to save the trouble. Thank you."

( 42m 46s ) Anna: ok ( 51m 20s ) Kayla R: Anna, in reviewing the notes that I have it is when a prorated lease renewal is finalized, that the prorated new rate charges post immediately and are future-dated for the first of the month that the lease renewal will take place (that's the September amount of 485.83). Then on the first of the renewal month, the old rate charges will post as well, and both the new and old rate charges will be added together, totaling up to the correct amount the tenant should be charged for the month.

( 3m 7s ) Rachel: correct thank you! ( 4m 53s ) Sarah H: One thing I observed is that you actually have a duplicate going on you have 2 applications per tenant and you have 2 future tenant pages per tenant (so 4 total of each) ( 4m 56s ) Sarah H: 2 are moving into 413 ( 5m 0s ) Sarah H: 2 are moving into 514 ( 5m 9s ) Sarah H: My thought is we cancel the one that's incorrect (the 413 one) ( 5m 45s ) Rachel: OK. So cancel the application for 413? I just wanted to make sure it wouldn't cancel the tenants for 514 b/c we already have a signed lease online. ( 6m 47s ) Sarah H: Wait wait don't do anything yet ( 7m 7s ) Rachel: ok ( 7m 16s ) Sarah H: Because I only see 1 application on the actual application page which is super odd. So let me just dig into this a little bit more so I can figure out why I'm seeing a duplicate ( 7m 58s ) Rachel: OK thank you! We moved them in as future tenants on 514, lease beginning on 4/1, so it was odd that the decision is pending for 413. ( 10m 19s ) Sarah H: Let's try canceling the move in for 413: ( 12m 40s ) Rachel: OK done! So they are back to ""Decision pending"" for 413. ( 12m 52s ) Rachel: What should we do to clear this out?

It will eventually disappear from the list with time. Or you can just delete the application altogether since it is a confirmed duplicate ( 20m 31s ) Sarah H: Whatever you feel comfortable with ( 20m 38s ) Sarah H: Are you still there?

( 16m 22s ) Nubia: No we do the total rent ( 17m 38s ) Logan L: Right, that is whatI thought.

This form is sent to the tenant by us and not automatic during the rental application correct? ( 15m 12s ) Liz C: Correct, you can send the form from within the move-in flow, from the application.

( 2m 50s ) Sandra V: It appears that the monthly recurring rent income charge was duplicated for this tenant. ( 4m 4s ) Sandra V: I see that the system created one when the renewal took effect on 10/31 but you also added one on October 18th. ( 4m 37s ) Adelaide: Yes, why? he was not the only tenant, I fixed the others but I need to know why it happened, one of the tenants had auto deduction and it caused major issues, especially since the charges didnt post right away ( 6m 0s ) Adelaide: it should have not auto generated one with the renewal, i was told that would not happen anymore. How can I view future charges for tenants? when I renew them I do not want it to auto post. this keeps happening ( 10m 6s ) Sandra V: I am not aware of a way to override this. The system expires the previous charge and creates a new one according to the lease renewal. One moment while I find a report that shows you furture charges. ( 13m 19s ) Sandra V: The renewal summary report has both, the previous rent and the new rent along with the date that the renewal took effect. You can run it for the next 6 months. This will pull data for leases that have been renewed but the charges have not posted. ( 14m 3s ) Adelaide: great thank you, because the problem lies in the fact that the new charges wont post on the statement sent out before the date of the first, yet it posts after and tenants either get duplicate charges or their statement has the wrong amount due? where can i find this report? ( 15m 18s ) Adelaide: I need to see future charges or stop this from happening, I asked to speak with a supervisor regarding this can you look at my prior cases and provide me with the supervisor assigned to me to resolve this issue?

Enter a question to start a conversation with a Live Support Agent. ( 1m 3s ) Aurora: We are having trouble doing the proper flow for a scheduled rent increase in combination with upcoming renewals. Can you guide us to make sure that when we do these that it isn't doubling the charge? ( 3m 59s ) Liz C: Hello, Aurora, I would be happy to look into this with you, if I may ask how are you currently increasing the rent? ( 5m 51s ) Liz C: Generally, in order to avoid a double rent increase submission, it is best to increase the rent within the 'Prepare Renewal Offer' task ( 23m 0s ) Liz C: Hello Aurora, are you still there? ( 23m 2s ) Liz C: :) ( 29m 13s ) Aurora: I'm sorry my computer was having problems. If youre still there I am available now ( 30m 9s ) Liz C: Yes still here! ( 31m 7s ) Aurora: Thank you for your patience! So our issue is that we are scheduling upcoming rental rate increases to take effect in 6 months. Then when the renewal for that upcoming term is generated it sees the charges as duplicated. ( 31m 23s ) Aurora: We think this is because the renewal offer also requires a rate to be entered. ( 32m 51s ) Aurora: If we were doing the renewal offer for the current offered term it would work, but we are giving 6 months notice due to Seattle tenant laws. ( 34m 38s ) Liz C: Correct, so as mentioned the 'Prepare Renewal Offer' task has a built-in feature that allows you to register the rent increase, so once the renewal is signed and executed, the new charges will be set up. The renewal can always be generated in advance and a new proposed rent can be shared with the tenant. ( 38m 14s ) Aurora: But the problem is that we are not offering the renewal itself 6 months ahead, we are just notifying the tenant 6 months ahead. So is there a correct way to execute a renewal for example that is renewing November 1st for a 6 month term at the same rate, and then attached is the notice for the rate to adjust in 6 months? ( 48m 10s ) Liz C: I see, thank you so much, while we do not have a supported feature that will allow you to post the rent two renewal terms in advance, you can send the renewal for that term and then additionally attach a customized lease addendum that is customized to reflect the future proposed rent there after. This would allow you to communicate the proposed rent to the tenant, but this will not reflect any posted rent. The rent can later be manually posted by using the rent increase task or by using the 'Prepare renewal offer task' for the next renewal ( 1h 5m 33s ) Liz C: Hello Aurora, it seems you may have stepped out. Please feel free to reach back out with a fresh support request or chat when you return. We are happy to assist!"
