# Goal: Fine tune a transformer model for summarization of domain-specific conversation text data
* summary_data_generator.py -> use standard huggingface summarization pipeline to quickly build a training dataset. keep the data that is closest to desired outcome. Could build more robust training dataset with labeling functions
